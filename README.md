# Catering-Management
Project which is supposed to represent an application for a catering company. The possible users that can use the
app are clients, employees and administrators. Clients can order menus and products, employees can process
the client's orders and administrators can modify the menu and get reports. The scope of the project was to
exemplify the use of Java streams, Java HashMaps, Java serialization and the Observer Design Pattern. The project
was written entirely in Java.
